        <p>
        Hello and welcome to my personal space! I’m Swaathi B., a passionate learner and sophomore at Shiv Nadar University Chennai. My journey is driven by a deep love for technology, music, and creativity, and I find joy in weaving these worlds together.

        <p>
        I’m fascinated by the power of coding and web development, and currently diving into full-stack development, machine learning, and data analysis. I’m eager to use technology to solve real-world problems and create impactful solutions through innovative projects.
        </p>
        <p>
        Alongside my tech pursuits, I’m an avid musician with a special passion for Carnatic music. I’m on an ongoing journey of learning and performing, discovering the perfect harmony between art and science.

        <p>When I’m not coding or immersed in music, you’ll find me creating art, exploring AI, and working on projects that push me to think creatively. My drive to learn, collaborate, and make a meaningful impact shapes everything I do.
